# Python - Async

This is a Holberton School projet to learn Asynchronous code.

## Requirements

### General
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Tasks Examples

#### 0. The basics of async

Write an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument (max_delay, with a default value of 10) named `wait_random` that waits for a random delay between 0 and `max_delay` (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it.

Use the `random` module.

# Task 1: Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async

## Description

Import `wait_random` from the previous python file that you’ve written and write an async routine called `wait_n` that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): `n` and `max_delay`. You will spawn `wait_random` `n` times with the specified `max_delay`.

`wait_n` should return the list of all the delays (float values). The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using `sort()` because of concurrency.
