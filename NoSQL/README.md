# NoSQL

This directory contains the Holberton School's project "No SQL".

## Description

This project aims to introduce us to the fundamentals of NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB, through a series of tasks. We learn about the basics of NoSQL, how it differs from SQL, document storage, types of NoSQL databases, benefits, and practical usage with MongoDB.

## Requirements

### MongoDB Command File

- All the files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using MongoDB (version 4.2)
- All the files should end with a new line
- The first line of all the files should be a comment: `// my comment`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

### Python Scripts

- All the files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7) and PyMongo (version 3.10)
- All rhe files should end with a new line
- The first line of all the files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)
- The length of the files will be tested using `wc`
- All the modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All the functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- The code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)

## Tasks Examples
