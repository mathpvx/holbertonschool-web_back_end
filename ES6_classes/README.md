# ES6 Classes

This is Holberton School project for ES6 Classes.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to define a Class
- How to add methods to a class
- Why and how

## Tasks Examples

### 2. A Course, Getters, and Setters

Implement a class named HolbertonCourse:

Constructor attributes:
name (String)
length (Number)
students (array of Strings)
Make sure to verify the type of attributes during object creation
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
Implement a getter and setter for each attribute.

### 8. Primitive - Holberton Class

Implement a class named HolbertonClass:

Constructor attributes:
size (Number)
location (String)
Each attribute must be stored in an “underscore” attribute version (ex: name is stored in _name)
When the class is cast into a Number, it should return the size.
When the class is cast into a String, it should return the location.
